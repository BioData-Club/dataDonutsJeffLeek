[BioData Club](https://biodata-club.github.io/), the [OHSU Library](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/library/), and BME are hosting a student and early career researcher roundtable discussion with Jeff Leek on **Thursday, May 11 from 10:00 to 11:00 AM in BICC 429**.  

We'll be discussing Jeff's work and the current and future states of scientific communication!  

To spark the conversation and introduce attendees to the concepts in Jeff's book, [How to Be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), BioData Club is organizing a short meet-up before the roundtable.

#### Join us from 9:30 - 10:00 in BICC 429 to join the conversation!

To kick things off we've posted an overview and some responses to three topics covered in the book:  **Data Sharing, Social Media, and Preprints**.

#### Navigate to the Issues tab in this repository to read and contribute to the conversation, or just show up on Thursday.

Here are a few questions to kick things off:

* Has your training prepared you to act on the practices Jeff recommends?  What are the gaps, and how can we help?
* Do you agree with the strategies and benefits Jeff describes?  Tell us why or why not?
* What barriers have you experienced when trying to share your data, use social media for science, or publish a preprint?

#### Feel free create new issues to comment on additional topics, and see you on Thursday!
