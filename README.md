# Data & Doughnuts with [Dr. Jeff Leek](http://jtleek.com/)

[BioData Club](https://biodata-club.github.io/), the [OHSU Library](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/library/), and BME are hosting a student and early career reseacher roundtable discussion with Jeff Leek on **Thursday, May 11 from 10:00 to 11:00 AM in BICC 429** (Everyone is Welcome!).  

We'll be discussing Jeff's work and the current and future states of scientific communication!  

To spark the conversation and introduce attendees to the concepts in Jeff's book, [How to Be a Modern Scientist](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist), BioData Club is organzing a short meet-up before the roundtable.

#### Join us from 9:30 - 10:00 in BICC 429 to join the coversation!

To kick things off we've posted an overview and some responses to three topics covered in the book:  **Data Sharing, Social Media, and Preprints**.
